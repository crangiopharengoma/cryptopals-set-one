# cryptopals
My attempt to complete the cryptopals challenges.

This project has two objectives:
1. Learn more about cryptosecurity
2. Improve my Rust skills

Sometimes this is probably going to reinvent wheels because I'm building my Rust knowledge at the same time as I'm solving the crypto problems.
